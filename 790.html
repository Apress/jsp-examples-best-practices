Correction: Code snippet from server.xml file should be as follows:<br>
<br>
&lt;Context path="jspBook" docBase="/jspBook" debug="0"/><br>
<br>

<br>
Note: Be sure to run mysqld prior to running the mysql command to create&nbsp;<br>
the tables in your database.<br>
<br>
Page 19:<br>
<br>
Note: You may wish to use the new Connector-J JDBC driver from www.mysql.com.&nbsp;<br>
Unzip the downloaded file and place the mysql-connector-java-2.0.14-bin.jar file&nbsp;<br>
in your classpath (your server classpath). To obtain a connection use the&nbsp;<br>
following code:<br>
<br>
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();<br>
<br>

<br>
Note: Some readers have reported trouble running the session example listed on&nbsp;<br>
this page. I suspect that they are trying to run the example starting with a page&nbsp;<br>
other than simpleSessionExample.html (perhaps the simpleSessionExample.jsp page).<br>
<br>
Chapter 3<br>
<br>
Page 49:<br>
<br>
Correction: All references to 'simpleBean' should in fact be 'SimpleBean'. The&nbsp;<br>
case was changed early on during development of the book and a few references to&nbsp;<br>
the old name remained after editing. The source code is named 'simpleBean.java'&nbsp;<br>
and should be changed to 'SimpleBean.java' (as well as the class name itself).&nbsp;<br>
This will eliminate any further confusion. The same changes can be made to the&nbsp;<br>
'productBean.java' file.<br>
<br>
Page 70 (CustomerBean.java):<br>
<br>
Note: It would be a good idea to actually clear all of the JavaBean's attributes&nbsp;<br>
prior to loading a new set of data. This could be accomplished by moving the&nbsp;<br>
initialization code out of the constructor and placing it in a separate method&nbsp;<br>
called initFields(). You could then call this method from both the constructor&nbsp;<br>
and the loadCustomer() methods.<br>
<br>
Page 79:<br>
<br>
Correction: Each of the &lt;option> tags are missing a closing bracket. Each tag&nbsp;<br>
should be something like this (the source code downloaded from the website is correct):<br>
<br>
&lt;select name="spouse"><br>
   &lt;option value="true" &lt;%= (custBean.getField("spouse",&nbsp;<br>
      FIELD_VALUE).equals("true")) ? "selected" : "" %>>Y&lt;/option><br>
   &lt;option value="false" &lt;%= (custBean.getField("spouse",&nbsp;<br>
      FIELD_VALUE).equals("false")) ? "selected" : "" %>>N&lt;/option><br>
&lt;/select><br>
<br>
Chapter 4<br>
<br>
Note: The case of several source files begin with a lowercase letter. These&nbsp;<br>
should each be changed to begin with an uppercase letter. The source file names&nbsp;<br>
as well as the class names themselves need to be modified. For example:<br>
<br>
groceryOrder.java --> GroceryOrder.java<br>
groceryItem.java --> GroceryItem.java<br>
simpleTag.java --> SimpleTag.java<br>
<br>
Page 97:<br>
<br>
Note: The example showing how to nest tags does not work with Tomcat 4.x. The&nbsp;<br>
code is written correctly to the JSP specifications and actually worked just&nbsp;<br>
fine with previous versions of Tomcat. With the newer releases of Tomcat, the&nbsp;<br>
nested tag example does not work correctly.<br>

Note: Remember to start the mysqld program before attempting to work with the database.</p>
